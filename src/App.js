          <h1><span className="hi-im">Hi, I'm</span>Ty Brass,</h1>
          <h2>a software developer.</h2>
          <p>I'm in my final year of a computer science degree and am looking for a
            position where I can start learning all those things they don't teach you in school.
            <br></br><br></br>I'm especially interested in full-stack web development (that's where my current
            experience lies), but I'd also be extremely open to learning about mobile development. </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I want to make things that anybody in the world can use.</p>
            <p>After completing a degree in English literature, I started
              on a computer science degree, and since then I've been developing
              what began as a slight interest in programming into a real passion
              for software development.<br></br><br></br>I'm comfortable working with Python,
              JavaScript, and HTML and CSS, and I've had experience with Java, C/C++,
              and React (used for this site), as well as a few others. You can get a
              more comprehensive run-down in my resume below.<br></br><br></br>Having worked as
              a contracted web developer for my university's newspaper, I have a
              slight bit of professional exerience, and I'm keen to find a professional
              environment working alongside other developers where I can learn from others and
              solve problems that I would never encounter when developing personal projects.</p>
