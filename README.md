# My Personal Site

I am starting this on April 18, at 4pm, and I'm hoping that with enough grit 
and gristle, I can learn React well enough to get this into a half-decent 
state by tomorrow morning.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
